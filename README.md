## Bootcamp carding matching game assignlent
Creating a card matching game for the app development bootcamp. The HTML, CSS, and parts of the JavaScript were already done when the assignment was given.
We were tasked with adding majority of the functionality of the matching game. Functions in script.js that have long descriptions over them were functions that we were tasked to implement.
